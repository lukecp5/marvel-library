            Daredevil, American comic strip superhero created for Marvel Comics
            by writer Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett. The character first
            appeared in Daredevil no. 1 (April 1964).

            When Daredevil was younger, he was blinded by a radioactive
            substance that fell from an oncoming vehicle, and even though he
            lost his sight, his other four senses were heightened to a
            superhuman level. As in most Marvel comics, Matt was motivated to
            fight crime by the death of a loved one â€” in this case, it was his
            father, a boxer who was killed by gangsters after he refused to
            throw a fight. Matt became Daredevil in order to avenge his father,
            and so "the man without fear" became a crime-fighting superhero.
