            Magneto was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby in 1963. 
            He made his first appearance in X-Men #1, becoming the very first foe of the 
            iconic mutant team. Creator Stan Lee stated that he "did not think of Magneto 
            as a bad guy. He was just trying to strike back at the people who were so bigoted 
            and racist. He was trying to defend mutants, and because society was not treating them 
            fairly, he decided to teach society a lesson.

            Magneto's powers extend further than hanging spoons and forks on his body; 
            he can generate and manipulate magnetic fields. His powers allow him to control 
            metal, levitate himself and others, create force fields, use telepathic mind 
            control, and generate electromagnetic pulses, among other abilities.
