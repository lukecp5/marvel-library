          Wolverine (birth name: James Howlett; alias: Logan and Weapon X) is a
          fictional character appearing in American comic books published by
          Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant
          who possesses animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, a
          powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, and three
          retractable claws in each hand. Wolverine has been depicted variously
          as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the Avengers.

          Wolverine's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process,
          typically referred to as his mutant healing factor, that regenerates
          damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal
          humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas,
          Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to
          diseases, drugs and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate
          effects of such substances in massive quantities; he has been seen to
          become intoxicated after ingesting significant amounts of
          alcohol, and has been incapacitated on several occasions with
          large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons; S.H.I.E.L.D. once
          managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty
          milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system.[
