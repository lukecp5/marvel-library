                Captain America, comic-strip superhero created by writer Joe Simon and artist
                 Jack Kirby for Timely (later Marvel) Comics. The character debuted in March 
                 1941 in Captain America Comics no. 1.

                Captain America has agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction time 
                superior to any Olympic athlete who ever competed. The Super-Soldier formula 
                that he has metabolized has enhanced all of his bodily functions to the peak of 
                human efficiency. Notably, his body eliminates the excessive build-up of 
                fatigue-producing poisons in his muscles, granting him phenomenal endurance.

                Captain America has mastered the martial art of American-style boxing and judo, 
                and has combined these disciplines with his own unique hand-to-hand style of combat. 
                He engages in a daily regimen of rigorous exercise (including aerobics, weight lifting, 
                gymnastics, and simulated combat) to keep himself in peek condition. Captain America is 
                one of the finest human combatants Earth has ever known.
