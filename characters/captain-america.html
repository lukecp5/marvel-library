            Captain America, comic-strip superhero created by writer Joe Simon
            and artist Jack Kirby for Timely (later Marvel) Comics. The
            character debuted in March 1941 in Captain America Comics no. 1.

            Captain America has agility, strength, speed, endurance, and
            reaction time superior to any Olympic athlete who ever competed. The
            Super-Soldier formula that he has metabolized has enhanced all of
            his bodily functions to the peak of human efficiency. Notably, his
            body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-producing poisons
            in his muscles, granting him phenomenal endurance. Captain America
            has mastered the martial art of American-style boxing and judo, and
            has combined these disciplines with his own unique hand-to-hand
            style of combat. He engages in a daily regimen of rigorous exercise
            (including aerobics, weight lifting, gymnastics, and simulated
            combat) to keep himself in peek condition. Captain America is one of
            the finest human combatants Earth has ever known.
