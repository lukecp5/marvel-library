                Daredevil, American comic strip superhero created for Marvel Comics 
                by writer Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett. The character first appeared in 
                Daredevil no. 1 (April 1964).

                When Daredevil was younger, he was blinded by a radioactive substance 
                that fell from an oncoming vehicle, and even though he lost his sight, his 
                other four senses were heightened to a superhuman level. As in most Marvel 
                comics, Matt was motivated to fight crime by the death of a loved one â€” in this 
                case, it was his father, a boxer who was killed by gangsters after he refused to 
                throw a fight. Matt became Daredevil in order to avenge his father, and so 
                "the man without fear" became a crime-fighting superhero.
